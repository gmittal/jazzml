Learning cool stuff about computers and jazz improvisation through [1 minute jazz lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D9i_VsmDAQE1jJPsXmWYaEf5y6Wl8FQ).

Real-time jazz improvisation using fast Fourier transforms, digital signal processing (for real-time chord prediction) and machine learning techniques (for musical improvisation).


### Installation
The program requires quite a few dependencies, the most notable being:
  - Python 2.x+
  - fluidsynth
  - music21
  - mingus
  - tensorflow
  - PyAudio 0.2.9

To install all dependencies via ```pip```, simply run the following.
```none
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running
The program attempts to improvise over chord changes that it detects in real-time via the microphone. Running the program without an external backing track doesn't lead to any particularly interesting results.

Running using the (boring and repetitive) defaults:

```none
$ python main.py
```

#### Training with Your Own Data
Create a JSON ```train.json``` file with the following format.

```javascript
{
  "data": [
    [2, 0.5],
    [3, 0.5],
    [4, 0.5],
    [5, 0.5],
    [3, 1],
    [1, 0.5],
    [2, 1]
  ]
}
```

Each element in the data array is a note, expressed with a scale degree and length in terms of beats â€” where 1 is a quarter note. If you have a better way for expressing these data files or for implementing more complex structure such as varying metres, please file a pull request.

Preprocess the raw ```train.json``` JSON file into a named dataset.

```none
$ python preprocess.py /path/to/train.json "my_dataset"
```

Now you can train the LSTM model on your dataset.

```none
$ python train.py /path/to/my_dataset
```

After you're done training for as long as you see fit, you can test your dataset was trained properly.

```none
$ python sample.py /path/to/my_dataset
```

You can then try it out to see how the machine improvises based on your dataset with the main program:

```none
$ python main.py
```
